- [ ] Document all available tools and resources
- [ ] Add diagrams for architecture overview
- [ ] Create examples for common use cases
- [ ] Document error codes and troubleshooting steps
- [ ] Update all API documentation

### Testing

  - ✅ Enhanced auth.ts unit tests with comprehensive coverage
  - [ ] Add tests for digital-samba-api.ts
  - [ ] Add tests for webhooks.ts and recordings.ts
- [ ] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting
- [x] Create mock services for testing
  - ✅ Created mock API responses for testing
  - ✅ Added mock transport and request objects
- [ ] Test error scenarios and edge cases

### Security

- [ ] Audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Ensure no sensitive data in the codebase
- [ ] Implement proper input validation
- [ ] Review authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Add security headers for HTTP responses
- [ ] Implement recommended security practices

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning

- Create inventory of all files and their purpose
- Identify redundant or unnecessary files
- Document areas needing improvement
- Set priorities for cleanup tasks

### Phase 2: Code Cleanup

- Apply code formatting and linting
- Remove debug code and unnecessary comments
- Improve error handling
- Enhance documentation
- Standardize naming conventions

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation

- Implement unit and integration tests
- Ensure all functionality works as expected
- Validate against Digital Samba API
- Test with Claude and other MCP clients

### Phase 4: Final Review

- Conduct comprehensive code review
- Verify all cleanup tasks are complete
- Check for any remaining issues
- Ensure consistency across the codebase

## Tools and Resources

- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Jest for testing
- TypeScript for type checking
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- MCP Inspector for protocol validation

## Coding Standards

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `digital-samba-api.ts`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `DigitalSambaClient`)
- **Interfaces**: PascalCase with 'I' prefix (e.g., `IApiClient`)
- **Variables and Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `createRoom`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`)

### Code Style

- 2 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length of 100 characters
- Semicolons required
- Single quotes for strings
- Trailing commas in multiline objects and arrays
- No unused variables or imports
- Explicit return types for functions

### Documentation

- JSDoc comments for all public functions, classes, and interfaces
- Inline comments for complex logic
- README.md for overview and getting started
- Separate documentation files for detailed topics

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a branch for each cleanup task
2. Make focused, specific changes
3. Add tests for the changes
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description
6. Have at least one team member review the changes

## Completion Criteria

- No linting errors or warnings
- All tests passing
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- No unnecessary files in the repository
- Code review approval from at least two team members
- Successful testing with Claude Desktop and MCP Inspector
