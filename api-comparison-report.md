# Digital Samba API Implementation Comparison Report

## Summary
After comparing the `digital-samba-api.ts` implementation against the official OpenAPI specification at https://developer.digitalsamba.com/rest-api/openapi.yaml, I've identified several discrepancies.

## 1. Endpoints in our code that don't exist in the official API

### Recording Management
- `PATCH /recordings/{recording}` - Update recording (method: `updateRecording`)
  - The official API doesn't support updating recordings

### Session Management
- `DELETE /sessions/{sessionId}/chat` through individual deletion methods
  - Our code has methods like `deleteSessionData` that use a pattern `/sessions/{sessionId}/{dataType}` 
  - The official API has these as separate endpoints

### Meeting Scheduling - **ENTIRE FEATURE SET MISSING**
All meeting-related endpoints in our code don't exist in the official API:
- `GET /meetings` - List scheduled meetings
- `POST /meetings` - Create scheduled meeting
- `GET /meetings/{meetingId}` - Get meeting details
- `PATCH /meetings/{meetingId}` - Update meeting
- `DELETE /meetings/{meetingId}` - Delete meeting
- `POST /meetings/{meetingId}/cancel` - Cancel meeting
- `GET /meetings/upcoming` - List upcoming meetings
- `GET /rooms/{roomId}/meetings` - List room meetings
- `POST /meetings/{meetingId}/participants` - Add participants
- `POST /meetings/{meetingId}/participants/remove` - Remove participants
- `POST /meetings/{meetingId}/reminders` - Send reminders
- `POST /meetings/available-times` - Find available times

### Breakout Rooms - **ENTIRE FEATURE SET MISSING**
All breakout room endpoints in our code don't exist in the official API:
- `GET /rooms/{roomId}/breakout-rooms` - List breakout rooms
- `POST /rooms/{roomId}/breakout-rooms` - Create breakout rooms
- `GET /rooms/{roomId}/breakout-rooms/{breakoutRoomId}` - Get breakout room
- `DELETE /rooms/{roomId}/breakout-rooms/{breakoutRoomId}` - Delete breakout room
- `DELETE /rooms/{roomId}/breakout-rooms` - Delete all breakout rooms
- `GET /rooms/{roomId}/breakout-rooms/{breakoutRoomId}/participants` - List participants
- `POST /rooms/{roomId}/breakout-rooms/assignments` - Assign participants
- `POST /rooms/{roomId}/breakout-rooms/return-all` - Return all to main
- `POST /rooms/{roomId}/breakout-rooms/broadcast` - Broadcast message
- `POST /rooms/{roomId}/breakout-rooms/open` - Open breakout rooms
- `POST /rooms/{roomId}/breakout-rooms/close` - Close breakout rooms

### Poll Management
- `POST /sessions/{sessionId}/polls/{pollId}/publish-results` - Publish poll results
  - Our code has this endpoint, but the official API doesn't document it

## 2. Missing endpoints that should be implemented

### Transcripts
- `GET /rooms/{room}/transcripts` - Get room transcripts
  - Our code doesn't have a method to retrieve transcripts

### Polls
- `GET /rooms/{room}/polls/{poll}` - Get specific poll
- `PATCH /rooms/{room}/polls/{poll}` - Update poll
- `DELETE /rooms/{room}/polls/{poll}` - Delete poll
  - These exist in our code but use slightly different patterns

## 3. Correct implementations with minor differences

### Export Endpoints
Our code implements these correctly but uses the native fetch API instead of the request method:
- `GET /rooms/{roomId}/chat/export`
- `GET /rooms/{roomId}/questions/export`
- `GET /rooms/{roomId}/polls/export`
- `GET /sessions/{sessionId}/transcripts/export`

## 4. Path inconsistencies

### Session Statistics
- Our code: `GET /sessions/{sessionId}` 
- Official API: `GET /sessions/{session}` and separate `/statistics` endpoint
- The parameter naming is inconsistent (sessionId vs session)

## Recommendations

1. **Remove non-existent features:**
   - Remove all meeting scheduling functionality
   - Remove all breakout room functionality
   - Remove the `updateRecording` method

2. **Add missing endpoints:**
   - Add `getRoomTranscripts` method for `GET /rooms/{room}/transcripts`

3. **Fix parameter naming:**
   - Consider using consistent parameter names (either {room} or {roomId}, {session} or {sessionId})

4. **Update documentation:**
   - Add comments indicating which features are not part of the official API
   - Update the CLAUDE.md file to reflect these limitations

5. **Consider feature flags:**
   - If these features are planned for future API releases, consider adding feature flags to enable/disable them
