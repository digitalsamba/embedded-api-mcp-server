# Advanced Timeout Fix for MCP Server

## Issue

After implementing the initial timeout fix, we still encountered a timeout error during initialization:

```

```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred because:

1. **Initialization Complexity**: During server startup, multiple API components (recordings, moderation, breakout rooms, and scheduling) were being initialized simultaneously, leading to a longer than expected startup time.

2. **Timeout Configuration**: The initial fix added an `initialRequestTimeout` parameter, but it wasn't being effectively applied to the initialization process, particularly for child components.

3. **Error Handling**: When timeout errors occurred during initialization, there wasn't enough diagnostic information to understand where and why they were happening.

## Solution Implementation

We made the following enhancements:

1. **Special Initialization Mode**: Added an `isInitialization` flag to the circuit breaker's `exec` method to completely bypass timeouts during critical initialization phases.

2. **Improved Debugging**: Added debug flags for timeout and initialization issues that provide extensive logging for troubleshooting.

3. **Environment Variable Override**: Created an `INITIAL_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` environment variable to override timeout settings without modifying code.

4. **Direct API Key Support**: Added support for providing an API key directly through server options, which removes the dependency on HTTP headers during initialization.

5. **Enhanced Request Retry Logic**: Improved the initialization process with better error handling and retry mechanisms.

## Files Changed

1. `src/circuit-breaker.ts`: Added `isInitialization` parameter and improved debug logging.
2. `src/digital-samba-api-circuit-breaker.ts`: Enhanced initialization with better error handling and retry logic.
3. `src/index.ts`: 
   - Added debug options support
   - Updated ServerOptions interface with new parameters
   - Improved API key handling with fallback mechanisms
4. Added debugging utilities:
   - `debug-timeout.js`: JavaScript script for testing with enhanced debugging
   - `debug-timeout.bat`: Batch file for running the debug script
   - `build-with-timeout-fix.bat`: Special build script for the timeout fix

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix:

1. Build the project with the timeout fix: `build-with-timeout-fix.bat`
2. Run the debug test: `debug-timeout.bat YOUR_API_KEY`
3. Observe the detailed logs to ensure proper initialization
4. Test with Claude Desktop or the MCP Inspector

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to fine-tune the timeout behavior:

- `INITIAL_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`: Override the timeout for the first request (in milliseconds)
- `DEBUG_TIMEOUTS`: Enable detailed timeout debugging (set to 'true')
- `DEBUG_INITIALIZATION`: Enable detailed initialization debugging (set to 'true')

## Command Line Options

When starting the server programmatically, you can provide these options:

```javascript
const server = startServer({
  initialRequestTimeout: 90000, // 90 seconds
  debugTimeouts: true,
  debugInitialization: true,
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" // Provide API key directly
});
```

## Conclusion

This enhanced timeout fix addresses the underlying issues with server initialization, making the startup process more reliable. By adding extensive debugging capabilities and addressing the key failure points, we've created a more robust initialization process that can handle the complexity of multiple API components starting up simultaneously.
