# Summary of Progress on Digital Samba MCP Server

## Recent Accomplishments

1. **Implemented Circuit Breaker Pattern for API Calls ✅**
   - Created comprehensive circuit breaker implementation in circuit-breaker.ts
   - Added three-state management (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF-OPEN) with configurable thresholds
   - Built circuit breaker registry for managing multiple circuit breakers
   - Implemented API client wrapper with circuit breaker protection
   - Added configuration options via environment variables and programmatic API
   - Integrated with Prometheus metrics for monitoring circuit state and events
   - Created detailed documentation and comprehensive test script
   - Git commit: d773d87

2. **Integrated Rate Limiting and Caching Implementation ✅**
   - Fixed issue with ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING constant in index.ts
   - Added proper MemoryCache import to digital-samba-api.ts
   - Fixed cache invalidation logic for delete operations
   - Ensured proper cache namespace usage across the application
   - Implemented an efficient token bucket algorithm for rate limiting

3. **Completed Import Standardization ✅**
   - Standardized imports in all source files according to our guidelines
   - Completed standardization of breakout-rooms.ts, recordings.ts, moderation.ts, meetings.ts, and webhooks.ts on 2025-06-02
   - Added proper categorization (Node.js modules, external deps, MCP SDK, local modules)
   - Alphabetized imports within each section for consistency
   - Verified the standards work effectively with our existing codebase
   - Ensured consistency across the entire codebase

4. **Finalized NPM Package Configuration**
   - Applied optimized configuration files (tsconfig.json, package.json, .npmignore)
   - Enhanced README.md with comprehensive installation and usage instructions
   - Successfully built the project with the new configuration
   - Verified proper generation of TypeScript declaration files
   - Ensured CLI script is properly included in the distribution

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Graceful Degradation for Partial API Outages**
   - Create fallback mechanisms for critical API endpoints
   - Implement feature flags to disable non-essential functionality during outages
   - Add cascading fallback strategies based on service health
   - Create comprehensive documentation for degradation scenarios
   - Add recovery mechanisms for when services become available again

2. **Optimize Resource Usage for High-Traffic Scenarios**
   - Implement memory usage optimization for high-traffic scenarios
   - Add metrics collection for monitoring resource usage
   - Create stress tests to validate performance under load
   - Optimize connection handling

3. **Implement Token Refresh Mechanism**
   - Design a token expiration detection system
   - Implement automatic token refresh in the API client
   - Add token expiration tracking
   - Create fallback mechanisms for token refresh failures

The project continues to make excellent progress with the implementation of the circuit breaker pattern, which significantly improves the system's resilience and fault tolerance. This complements our previous work on rate limiting and caching. The circuit breaker pattern helps prevent cascading failures when the Digital Samba API is experiencing issues, providing graceful error handling and automatic recovery. Our next focus will be on implementing graceful degradation strategies for partial API outages, which builds upon the circuit breaker work to provide even more robust operation in challenging conditions.
