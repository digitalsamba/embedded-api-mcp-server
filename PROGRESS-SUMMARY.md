# Summary of Progress on Digital Samba MCP Server

## Recent Accomplishments

1. **Continuing Import Standardization**
   - Standardized imports in multiple source files according to our guidelines
   - Standardized imports in breakout-rooms.ts and recordings.ts on 2025-06-02
   - Added proper categorization (Node.js modules, external deps, MCP SDK, local modules)
   - Alphabetized imports within each section for consistency
   - Verified the standards work effectively with our existing codebase

2. **Finalized NPM Package Configuration**
   - Applied optimized configuration files (tsconfig.json, package.json, .npmignore)
   - Enhanced README.md with comprehensive installation and usage instructions
   - Successfully built the project with the new configuration
   - Verified proper generation of TypeScript declaration files
   - Ensured CLI script is properly included in the distribution

3. **NPM Package Testing**
   - Verified that TypeScript declarations are correctly generated
   - Confirmed that the file structure in the dist folder matches our expected layout
   - Ensured proper module paths and entry points in package.json
   - Validated that the modular exports configuration works correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Import Standardization**
   - Apply the same import standards to the remaining source files
   - Verify no unused imports across the codebase
   - Ensure consistent import patterns in all modules

2. **Add Tests for Remaining Modules**
   - Identify modules without comprehensive test coverage
   - Create unit tests for those modules
   - Ensure all error handling scenarios are tested
   - Run the full test suite to verify overall functionality

3. **Package Publication Preparation**
   - Set up package versioning strategy
   - Configure GitHub Actions for automated publishing
   - Create integration examples for common use cases

The project has made significant progress toward npm package readiness. With the standardized imports and optimized package configuration, the codebase is much more maintainable and ready for publication. The next focus should be on completing test coverage to ensure reliability across all modules.
