# Summary of Today's Progress on Digital Samba MCP Server

## Accomplishments

1. **Enhanced Recordings Module with Standardized Error Handling**
   - Integrated the error types module with recordings.ts
   - Replaced generic errors with specific typed errors for better error handling
   - Added detailed error messages with contextual information
   - Improved user experience with more specific error handling based on HTTP status codes
   - Implemented domain-specific error handling for recording-related errors

2. **Added Comprehensive Unit Tests**
   - Created recordings.test.ts with tests for all major functionality
   - Tested both resource handlers and tool handlers
   - Covered success scenarios and various error conditions
   - Added proper mocking for all dependencies
   - Validated specific error type handling for each scenario

3. **Documentation and Project Management**
   - Created daily notes for today's work in the Obsidian vault
   - Committed all changes to git with descriptive commit messages
   - Tracked progress on the cleanup task

## Progress on Codebase Cleanup Plan

We've now implemented standardized error handling in three key modules:
- breakout-rooms.ts
- moderation.ts
- recordings.ts

This represents significant progress on the error handling aspect of the codebase cleanup plan.

## Next Steps

The next focus areas for the codebase cleanup are:

1. **Remaining Module Updates**
   - Apply the same error handling patterns to webhooks.ts and meetings.ts
   - Create unit tests for these modules
   - Ensure consistent error handling across all modules

2. **Code Cleanup and Optimization**
   - Remove unnecessary console.log statements and debug code
   - Standardize code formatting and style across all files
   - Optimize imports and dependencies
   - Clean up any redundant or unused code

3. **NPM Package Configuration**
   - Begin work on optimizing the package structure
   - Configure TypeScript declaration files
   - Set up proper entry points and exports
   - Create comprehensive package documentation

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Run the full test suite to verify all modules work correctly
   - Validate consistency across all modules
   - Ensure test coverage is adequate

Moving forward, we should continue following the established patterns for error handling to maintain consistency across the codebase. The current implementation in breakout-rooms.ts, moderation.ts, and recordings.ts provides a solid template for the remaining modules.
