# Summary of Progress on Digital Samba MCP Server

## Recent Accomplishments

1. **Integrated Rate Limiting and Caching Implementation ✅**
   - Fixed issue with ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING constant in index.ts
   - Added proper MemoryCache import to digital-samba-api.ts
   - Fixed cache invalidation logic for delete operations
   - Ensured proper cache namespace usage across the application
   - Implemented an efficient token bucket algorithm for rate limiting

2. **Completed Import Standardization ✅**
   - Standardized imports in all source files according to our guidelines
   - Completed standardization of breakout-rooms.ts, recordings.ts, moderation.ts, meetings.ts, and webhooks.ts on 2025-06-02
   - Added proper categorization (Node.js modules, external deps, MCP SDK, local modules)
   - Alphabetized imports within each section for consistency
   - Verified the standards work effectively with our existing codebase
   - Ensured consistency across the entire codebase

3. **Finalized NPM Package Configuration**
   - Applied optimized configuration files (tsconfig.json, package.json, .npmignore)
   - Enhanced README.md with comprehensive installation and usage instructions
   - Successfully built the project with the new configuration
   - Verified proper generation of TypeScript declaration files
   - Ensured CLI script is properly included in the distribution

## Next Steps

1. **Optimize Resource Usage for High-Traffic Scenarios**
   - Implement memory usage optimization for high-traffic scenarios
   - Add metrics collection for monitoring resource usage
   - Create stress tests to validate performance under load
   - Optimize connection handling

2. **Implement Token Refresh Mechanism**
   - Design a token expiration detection system
   - Implement automatic token refresh in the API client
   - Add token expiration tracking
   - Create fallback mechanisms for token refresh failures

3. **Add Tests for Remaining Modules**
   - Identify modules without comprehensive test coverage
   - Create unit tests for those modules
   - Ensure all error handling scenarios are tested
   - Run the full test suite to verify overall functionality

The project has made significant progress with the implementation of rate limiting and caching, which will help protect the Digital Samba API from overuse and improve response times. The codebase is now more maintainable with standardized imports and optimized package configuration. The next focus will be on optimizing resource usage for high-traffic scenarios and implementing a token refresh mechanism to enhance reliability.
