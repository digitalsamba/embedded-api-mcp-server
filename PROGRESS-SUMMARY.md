The project has made excellent progress with the implementation of the testing infrastructure. The comprehensive test suite now includes unit tests for core components, integration tests for complete request flows, and end-to-end tests with a mock API server. The mock API server provides a controlled environment for testing with configurable failure rates and network latency, ensuring the MCP server can handle various edge cases and error scenarios. The test fixtures and utilities make it easy to set up test environments and validate server functionality in a consistent manner.
