   - Alphabetized imports within each section for consistency
   - Verified the standards work effectively with our existing codebase
   - Ensured consistency across the entire codebase

## Next Steps

1. **Optimize Resource Usage for High-Traffic Scenarios**
   - Implement memory usage optimization for high-traffic scenarios
   - Add metrics collection for monitoring resource usage
   - Create stress tests to validate performance under load
   - Optimize connection handling

2. **Implement Token Refresh Mechanism**
   - Design a token expiration detection system
   - Implement automatic token refresh in the API client
   - Add token expiration tracking
   - Create fallback mechanisms for token refresh failures

3. **Finalize npm Package Configuration**
   - Set up package versioning strategy
   - Create integration examples for common use cases
   - Configure GitHub Actions for automated publishing
   - Set up release process

The project continues to make excellent progress with the implementation of the graceful degradation pattern, which significantly improves the system's resilience and fault tolerance. Together with the previously implemented circuit breaker pattern, these features provide a comprehensive approach to handling API outages. The graceful degradation pattern helps prevent service disruption when the Digital Samba API experiences issues, providing fallback mechanisms and automatic recovery.
