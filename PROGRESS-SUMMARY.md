- ✅ Error handling standardization (completed across all modules)
- ✅ Removal of debug code and console.log statements
- ✅ Creation of proper TypeScript type definitions
- ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc documentation for core modules

## Next Steps

The next focus areas for continued improvement are:

1. **Code Organization and Optimization**
   - Optimize imports and dependencies across all files
   - Remove unnecessary files and directories
   - Standardize code formatting and style
   - Ensure proper file permissions in the repository

2. **NPM Package Configuration**
   - Set up proper TypeScript declaration files
   - Configure entry points and exports
   - Optimize package structure and dependencies
   - Create comprehensive package documentation
   - Set up package versioning strategy

3. **Additional Testing Coverage**
   - Add tests for remaining modules
   - Validate all error handling scenarios
   - Ensure comprehensive test coverage

All standardized error handling is now in place across the entire codebase, providing consistent and informative error messages to users, as well as proper error propagation and handling throughout the application.
