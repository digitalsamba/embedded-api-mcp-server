# Summary of Today's Progress on Digital Samba MCP Server

## Accomplishments

1. **Completed Error Handling Standardization**
   - Verified standardized error handling across all remaining modules
   - Confirmed webhooks.ts already uses appropriate error types from errors.ts
   - Confirmed meetings.ts already uses appropriate error types from errors.ts
   - Completed review of all source code files for error handling consistency

2. **Imports Standardization**
   - Created import ordering guidelines document in docs/import-guidelines.md
   - Standardized imports in index.ts according to the guidelines
   - Organized imports into logical sections (Node.js modules, external deps, MCP SDK, local modules)
   - Alphabetized imports within each section for consistency and readability

3. **NPM Package Configuration Optimization**
   - Created optimized tsconfig.json with enhanced type generation
   - Updated package.json with proper export fields for modular imports
   - Created comprehensive .npmignore file to exclude development artifacts
   - Developed enhanced README.md with installation, usage instructions, and examples
   - Added proper TypeScript type declaration configuration

## Progress on Codebase Cleanup Plan

We've now completed several major aspects of the codebase cleanup plan:
- ✅ Error handling standardization (completed across all modules)
- ✅ Removal of debug code and console.log statements
- ✅ Creation of proper TypeScript type definitions
- ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc documentation for core modules
- ✅ Import ordering standardization with formal guidelines
- ✅ NPM package configuration optimized for publication

## Next Steps

The next focus areas for continued improvement are:

1. **Apply Import Standards to All Files**
   - Apply the import ordering guidelines to all remaining source files
   - Verify no unused imports across the codebase
   - Ensure consistent import patterns in all modules

2. **Finalize NPM Package Configuration**
   - Review and finalize the new tsconfig.json, package.json, and .npmignore files
   - Replace the existing configuration files with the optimized versions
   - Ensure proper file permissions in the repository
   - Test building the package with the new configuration

3. **Add Tests for Remaining Modules**
   - Identify modules without comprehensive test coverage
   - Create unit tests for those modules
   - Ensure all error handling scenarios are tested
   - Run the full test suite to verify overall functionality

These changes collectively improve code quality, maintainability, and the package's usability for consumers. The optimized npm package configuration prepares the project for publication, making it easier for users to integrate with the Digital Samba API through standardized MCP interfaces.
