# Digital Samba MCP Server - Cleanup Progress and Next Steps

## Completed Tasks

1. **Standardized Error Handling Implementation**
   - Created dedicated errors.ts module with specialized error types
   - Implemented standardized error handling in breakout-rooms.ts
   - Implemented standardized error handling in moderation.ts
   - Implemented standardized error handling in recordings.ts
   - Added comprehensive unit tests for all three modules
   - Improved error messaging and user experience

2. **Documentation**
   - Added daily notes in Obsidian Vault to track progress
   - Created progress summary document
   - Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to modules
   - Added detailed type definitions for method parameters and return values

3. **Testing**
   - Implemented unit tests for breakout-rooms.ts
   - Implemented unit tests for moderation.ts
   - Implemented unit tests for recordings.ts
   - Created testing utilities and mock fixtures

## Next Tasks

1. **Continue Standardizing Error Handling**
   - Implement standardized error handling in meetings.ts
   - Implement standardized error handling in webhooks.ts
   - Add unit tests for these modules

2. **Code Cleanup and Optimization**
   - Remove redundant files and debug code
   - Standardize code style across all files
   - Optimize imports and dependencies
   - Run full test suite to verify functionality

3. **NPM Package Configuration**
   - Begin work on optimizing package structure
   - Configure TypeScript declaration files
   - Set up proper entry points and exports

4. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Update main README.md with current functionality
   - Create usage examples for each module
   - Improve installation and configuration instructions

## Immediate Next Step

The highest priority task is to update the meetings.ts module with standardized error handling, following the same pattern used for the other modules. This includes:

1. Importing and using specialized error types
2. Enhancing error messages with contextual information
3. Implementing domain-specific error handlers
4. Creating comprehensive unit tests

After completing the meetings.ts module, we should move on to webhooks.ts and then focus on overall code cleanup and optimization.
