# Session Handover: Next Steps for Digital Samba MCP Server v2.0

## Date: January 2025

## Current Status
- ✅ All unit tests passing (119/119)
- ✅ All integration tests passing individually (11/11)
- ✅ E2E tests mostly passing (31/33)
- ⚠️  2 tests fail when full suite runs (test interference issue)
- 📊 Overall: 161/163 tests passing (98.8% pass rate)

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Setup (Priority: HIGH)
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18, 20, 21]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run test:coverage
```

Additional workflows needed:
- `release.yml` - Automated npm publishing on tags
- `codeql.yml` - Security scanning

### 2. Documentation Updates (Priority: HIGH)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

Files to update:
- **README.md**:
  - Remove references to deleted features (HTTP transport, circuit breakers, etc.)
  - Update installation instructions
  - Add v2.0 migration guide
  - Update usage examples

- **CHANGELOG.md**:
  ```markdown
  ## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-XX
  ### Breaking Changes
  - Removed HTTP transport (stdio only)
  - Removed enterprise features (circuit breakers, rate limiting)
  - Simplified to environment-based authentication
  
  ### Added
  - Full MCP protocol compliance
  - Improved error handling
  - Better test coverage (98.8%)
  
  ### Fixed
  - Analytics tool execution
  - Recording tools functionality
  - Session resource API key handling
  ```

- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** (new file):
  - Common errors and solutions
  - API limitations
  - Known issues

### 3. Fix Test Interference (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours

Issues to investigate:
- Mock server port conflicts (use random ports)
- Process cleanup timing
- Test isolation (add beforeEach/afterEach cleanup)
- Consider running integration tests serially

Potential solutions:
```javascript
// Use random port for each test
const mockApiPort = 8000 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);

// Add proper cleanup
afterEach(async () => {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
});
```

### 4. Pre-Release Testing (Priority: HIGH)
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours

- [ ] Test with real Digital Samba API key
- [ ] Test all endpoints against production API
- [ ] Verify Claude Desktop integration
- [ ] Performance testing (memory leaks, long-running)
- [ ] Security audit (`npm audit`)

### 5. Release Process (Priority: HIGH)
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

1. Update version in package.json to `2.0.0`
2. Remove beta tag
3. Final test run
4. Git tag: `git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Release v2.0.0"`
5. Push tags: `git push origin v2.0.0`
6. NPM publish: `npm publish`
7. Create GitHub release with changelog

## Known Issues to Document

### API Limitations
- Start/stop recording not implemented in API
- Archive/unarchive recording not implemented
- Some analytics endpoints may not exist
- Update recording metadata not supported

### Test Environment
- 2 tests fail when run as full suite but pass individually
- "Worker process failed to exit" warnings (cosmetic)
- Mock server uses fixed data for some endpoints

### Future Improvements
- Add connection retry logic
- Improve error messages
- Add configuration file support
- Implement caching improvements
- Add rate limiting protection
