# API Reference Audit Summary

## Quick Fixes Applied

1. **Resource Count**: Changed from "29 Available" to "26 Available"
2. **Tool Count**: Changed from "50+ Available" to "70 Available"
3. **Removed Non-existent Resources**:
   - `digitalsamba://recordings/archived`
   - `digitalsamba://rooms/{id}/recordings`

## Issues NOT Fixed (Need Decision)

1. **Missing Content Resource**: README still lists `digitalsamba://content` in line 153 but it doesn't exist
2. **Unused Code**: `/src/resources/recordings/index.ts` has the archived/room recordings but uses old MCP pattern

## Naming Suggestion

Consider renaming from "Digital Samba MCP Server" to "Digital Samba MCP API Client" because:
- It's primarily an API client that exposes Digital Samba functionality via MCP
- The term "server" might be confusing as it's really a client to Digital Samba's API
- MCP servers are protocol servers, but this is fundamentally an API client wrapper
