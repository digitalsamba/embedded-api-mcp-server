# Session Handover - MCP Testing Plan

## Date: 2025-06-10

## Summary
User proposed an excellent testing approach: Add the Digital Samba MCP server as an available MCP server to Claude Code, then use Claude Code to systematically test all functionality.

## Current State
1. **Completed Work**:
   - Changed all `--api-key` references to `--developer-key` throughout codebase
   - Fixed all test failures (163 tests passing)
   - Improved version visibility with startup banner
   - Explained `metadata: undefined` entries in logs (normal Claude Desktop behavior)

2. **Latest Version**: 
   - NPM: `@digitalsamba/embedded-api-mcp-server@0.1.0-beta.20250610133626`
   - Internal version shows as `0.1.0-beta.1` (this is normal for beta releases)

## Next Session Plan

### 1. Setup
- User needs to restart Claude Code after adding Digital Samba MCP server
- Configuration in Claude Desktop should use:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "digitalsamba": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@digitalsamba/embedded-api-mcp-server@latest", "--developer-key", "YOUR_DEVELOPER_KEY"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Testing Approach
- Claude Code will have access to Digital Samba MCP tools/resources
- Work through comprehensive testing checklist (see `mcp-testing-with-claude-code.md`)
- Document all bugs and unexpected behaviors
- Create prioritized fix list

### 3. Known Issues to Test
- Resource routing: Claude sometimes uses wrong tool (e.g., `get-recordings` instead of room resource)
- Version display discrepancy
- Any undiscovered API coverage gaps

### 4. Expected Benefits
- Real-world testing in actual Claude environment
- Systematic coverage of all features
- Clear bug reproduction steps
- Improved user experience through bug fixes
