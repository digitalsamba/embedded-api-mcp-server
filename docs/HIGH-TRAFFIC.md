# Digital Samba MCP Server - High-Traffic Optimizations

This document describes the high-traffic optimizations implemented in the Digital Samba MCP Server to improve performance, stability, and reliability in demanding environments.

## Overview

Three key optimizations have been implemented:

1. **Token Refresh Mechanism** - Automatically refreshes API tokens before they expire
2. **Connection Management** - Maintains stable connections with automatic reconnection and keepalive
3. **Resource Optimization** - Improves performance in high-traffic scenarios with batching and other techniques

## Configuration

These features can be enabled in your `.env` file or when calling the server programmatically:

```env
# Enable/disable high-traffic optimizations
ENABLE_CONNECTION_MANAGEMENT=true
ENABLE_TOKEN_MANAGEMENT=true
ENABLE_RESOURCE_OPTIMIZATION=true

# Connection pool size (default: 5)
CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE=10
```

When calling the server programmatically:

```typescript
import { startServer } from 'digital-samba-mcp';

const server = startServer({
  port: 3000,
  enableConnectionManagement: true,
  enableTokenManagement: true,
  enableResourceOptimization: true,
  connectionPoolSize: 10
});
```

## Token Refresh Mechanism

The token refresh mechanism automatically refreshes API tokens before they expire, ensuring uninterrupted service for clients.

### Features

- **Automatic Refresh**: Tokens are refreshed before they expire based on a configurable margin
- **Background Processing**: Refresh happens in the background without interrupting ongoing operations
- **Retry Logic**: Failed refresh attempts use exponential backoff for resilience
- **Event Notifications**: Events are emitted for token lifecycles (generated, refreshing, refreshed, etc.)

### Usage

Token refresh is automatically used when `enableTokenManagement` is set to `true`. No additional configuration is required.

## Connection Management

Connection management maintains stable connections to the Digital Samba API with automatic reconnection and connection health monitoring.

### Features

- **Connection Pooling**: Maintains a pool of connections for improved throughput
- **Health Monitoring**: Monitors connection health and reconnects automatically
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Uses exponential backoff for failed reconnection attempts
- **Keepalive**: Prevents connections from timing out during idle periods

### Usage

Connection management is automatically used when `enableConnectionManagement` is set to `true`. The pool size can be configured with `connectionPoolSize`.

## Resource Optimization

Resource optimization improves performance in high-traffic scenarios with batching, incremental loading, and memory usage optimization.

### Features

- **Request Batching**: Combines multiple similar requests to reduce API calls
- **Incremental Loading**: Loads large datasets in smaller chunks for better responsiveness
- **Memory Optimization**: Monitors and optimizes memory usage to prevent OOM errors
- **Response Compression**: Reduces response size for improved network performance

### Usage

Resource optimization is automatically used when `enableResourceOptimization` is set to `true`. No additional configuration is required.

## Testing

A test script is provided to verify that the high-traffic optimizations are working correctly:

```bash
npm run test:enhanced-features
```

or use the batch file:

```bash
test-enhanced-features.bat
```

## Best Practices

For optimal performance in high-traffic scenarios:

1. Enable all three optimizations (connection management, token management, and resource optimization)
2. Adjust the connection pool size based on your expected traffic (5-10 is usually sufficient)
3. Monitor memory usage and adjust application resources accordingly
4. Use incremental loading for large datasets to avoid memory pressure

## Limitations

- **Memory Usage**: The optimizations may increase memory usage slightly due to connection pooling
- **Startup Time**: Initial startup time may increase slightly due to connection initialization
- **Compatibility**: Some third-party clients may not fully support token refresh

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the high-traffic optimizations:

1. Check the logs for error messages
2. Verify that the optimizations are enabled in your configuration
3. Try reducing the connection pool size if memory usage is high
4. Disable individual optimizations to isolate the issue
