## How to Use the MCP Server with Claude Desktop

### Step 1: Build and Link the Package

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd C:\Users\ffxxr\Documents\DS\projects\digital-samba-mcp

# Run the link-local.bat script
link-local.bat
```

### Step 2: Start the Server

Option 1: Using the dedicated script:
```bash
run-for-claude-desktop.bat
```
(You'll be prompted to enter your Digital Samba API key)

Option 2: Using the CLI directly:
```bash
digital-samba-mcp --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Step 3: Configure Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to Settings > Advanced > MCP Servers
3. Add a new MCP server:
   - Name: Digital Samba
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/mcp` 
   - Headers:
     - Name: `Authorization`
     - Value: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` (replace with your actual API key)

### Step 4: Test the Connection

1. In Claude Desktop, select the Digital Samba MCP server
2. Ask Claude to list your Digital Samba rooms:
   "List my Digital Samba meeting rooms"
3. If successful, you should see a list of your rooms

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Run the test script to validate your server and API key:
   ```bash
   run-test.bat
   ```

2. Check common authentication issues:
   - Verify the API key is correct
   - Make sure the Authorization header includes "Bearer " prefix
   - Confirm the server is running and accessible

3. See TROUBLESHOOTING.md for more detailed solutions

## Next Steps

1. Continue testing with Claude Desktop to ensure reliable integration
2. Implement moderation tools for meeting management
3. Add support for breakout rooms
4. Create a GitHub repository for the project
5. Set up unit testing framework with Jest
6. Create Docker configuration for containerized deployment
7. Consider adding authentication caching for better performance

To test the recording functionality, use this command:
```bash
npm run test:recording
```
Or run the batch file:
```bash
test-recording.bat
```
