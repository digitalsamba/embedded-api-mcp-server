## How to Use the MCP Server with Claude Desktop

### Step 1: Build and Link the Package

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd C:\Users\ffxxr\Documents\DS\projects\digital-samba-mcp

# Run the link-local.bat script
link-local.bat
```

### Step 2: Start the Server

Option 1: Using the dedicated script:
```bash
run-for-claude-desktop.bat
```
(You'll be prompted to enter your Digital Samba API key)

Option 2: Using the CLI directly:
```bash
digital-samba-mcp --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Option 3: Enable rate limiting and caching:
```bash
digital-samba-mcp --api-key YOUR_API_KEY --enable-rate-limiting --rate-limit-requests 60 --enable-cache --cache-ttl 300000
```

### Step 3: Configure Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to Settings > Advanced > MCP Servers
3. Add a new MCP server:
   - Name: Digital Samba
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/mcp` 
   - Headers:
     - Name: `Authorization`
     - Value: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` (replace with your actual API key)

### Step 4: Test the Connection

1. In Claude Desktop, select the Digital Samba MCP server
2. Ask Claude to list your Digital Samba meeting rooms:
   "List my Digital Samba meeting rooms"
3. If successful, you should see a list of your rooms

## Test Scripts

To test the various functionalities, use these commands:

```bash
# General server test
npm run test:server

# Recording functionality
npm run test:recording
# Or run the batch file:
test-recording.bat

# Moderation functionality
npm run test:moderation
# Or run the batch file:
test-moderation.bat

# Breakout rooms functionality
npm run test:breakout
# Or run the batch file:
test-breakout-rooms.bat

# Meeting scheduling functionality
npm run test:meetings
# Or run the batch file:
test-meeting-scheduling.bat

# Rate limiting and caching functionality
npm run test:rate-limiting-caching
# Or run the batch file:
test-rate-limiting-caching.bat
```

## Next Steps

## Versioning and Release Plan

We've implemented a semantic versioning strategy as outlined in docs/versioning-strategy.md:

- Current version: 0.1.0 (Development phase)
- Next planned releases:
  - 0.2.0: Feature-complete beta release (est. June 2025)
  - 1.0.0: First stable release, production ready (est. July 2025)

The GitHub Actions pipeline is now configured to:
1. Run tests on all branches and pull requests
2. Build the package for multiple Node.js versions
3. Automatically bump patch versions on the main branch
4. Create GitHub releases and publish to NPM for tagged versions

## Integration Examples

New integration examples are available in the /examples directory:

1. **Basic Server**: Simple setup of a Digital Samba MCP server
2. **Node.js Client**: Using the Digital Samba API client in Node.js
3. **Express Integration**: Integrating MCP server with Express
4. **Advanced Configuration**: Configuring MCP server with advanced options
5. **Custom Extensions**: Adding custom tools and resources

These examples showcase common integration patterns and can be used as starting points for custom implementations.
