## How to Use the MCP Server with Claude Desktop

### Step 1: Build and Link the Package

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd C:\Users\ffxxr\Documents\DS\projects\digital-samba-mcp

# Run the link-local.bat script
link-local.bat
```

### Step 2: Start the Server

Option 1: Using the dedicated script:
```bash
run-for-claude-desktop.bat
```
(You'll be prompted to enter your Digital Samba API key)

Option 2: Using the CLI directly:
```bash
digital-samba-mcp --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Option 3: Enable rate limiting and caching:
```bash
digital-samba-mcp --api-key YOUR_API_KEY --enable-rate-limiting --rate-limit-requests 60 --enable-cache --cache-ttl 300000
```

### Step 3: Configure Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to Settings > Advanced > MCP Servers
3. Add a new MCP server:
   - Name: Digital Samba
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/mcp` 
   - Headers:
     - Name: `Authorization`
     - Value: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` (replace with your actual API key)

### Step 4: Test the Connection

1. In Claude Desktop, select the Digital Samba MCP server
2. Ask Claude to list your Digital Samba rooms:
   "List my Digital Samba meeting rooms"
3. If successful, you should see a list of your rooms
