# Contributing to Digital Samba MCP Server

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Digital Samba MCP Server as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the documentation with details of changes to interfaces, tools, resources, etc.
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of the maintainers

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

### Write Bug Reports with Detail, Background, and Sample Code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* We use TypeScript for this project
* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Run `npm run lint` to check your code style
