# NPM Deployment Progress Report - 2025-05-21

## Issues Resolved:
1. **TypeScript Build Errors Fixed**
   - Fixed TypeScript errors in `digital-samba-api-enhanced.ts` related to `ConnectionManager` interface
   - Added missing methods (`isHealthy()` and `getStats()`) to the `ConnectionManager` class
   - Added missing `poolSize` property to `ConnectionManagerOptions` interface
   - Successfully built the project with `npm run build:clean`

2. **Additional TypeScript Build Error Fixed**
   - Fixed TS2741 error: Property 'poolSize' missing in Required<ConnectionManagerOptions>
   - Updated ConnectionManager constructor to properly initialize poolSize property with default value
   - Added poolSize to the logger output and getStats() method

3. **Test Coverage Added**
   - Created test script `tests/test-connection-manager.js` to validate fixed functionality
   - Added batch file `test-connection-manager.bat` for easy testing
   - All tests passing, confirming the fixes are working correctly

## Current Status:
- TypeScript compilation now succeeds without errors
- All source files are properly compiled to JavaScript with declaration files
- Test coverage added for previously problematic areas
- Project now properly builds for npm packaging

## Next Steps:
1. Continue validating the npm package with local installations
2. Ensure compatibility with clients using the package
3. Prepare for official npm publication
4. Update documentation to reflect the recent changes
