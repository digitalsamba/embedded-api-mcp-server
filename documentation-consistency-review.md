# Documentation Consistency Review

## Executive Summary

After reviewing all documentation files, I found several inconsistencies that need to be addressed:

### Tool and Resource Counts

**Actual Implementation:**
- **Tools**: 102 unique tools found in implementation
- **Resources**: 37 unique resources found in implementation

**Documentation Claims:**
- **README.md**: States "99+ tools and 32 resources" (line 20)
- **CLAUDE.md**: States "32 Resources" and "70+ Tools" (lines 130-131)

### Specific Issues Found

1. **Tool Count Discrepancy**
   - README.md claims "99+ tools" which is close to accurate (102 found)
   - CLAUDE.md claims "70+ Tools" which is outdated
   - The discrepancy likely comes from the addition of reader tools (hybrid approach)

2. **Resource Count Discrepancy**
   - Both README.md and CLAUDE.md claim "32 resources"
   - Actually found 37 resources in implementation
   - Additional resources may have been added without updating documentation

3. **Tool Names Inconsistencies**
   - Found some unexpected tool names like "Team Meeting" which appears to be test data
   - Some tools mentioned in documentation may not match exact implementation names

4. **Architecture Description**
   - Both README.md and CLAUDE.md have similar architecture sections but with slight differences
   - CLAUDE.md mentions "role-management" in tools directory structure but README.md doesn't (line 384)

5. **Outdated Information in CLAUDE.md**
   - Still references the old tool count (70+) before the hybrid approach implementation
   - The "Known Issues & Design Considerations" section is duplicated in both files but with slight variations

6. **Missing Documentation Updates**
   - New tools added through the hybrid approach are listed in README.md but not all are reflected in CLAUDE.md
   - The version resource mentioned in implementation is not documented

### Recommendations

1. **Update Tool Counts**
   - README.md: Keep "99+ tools" or update to exact "102 tools"
   - CLAUDE.md: Update from "70+ Tools" to match README.md

2. **Update Resource Counts**
   - Both files: Update from "32 resources" to "37 resources"

3. **Synchronize Architecture Descriptions**
   - Ensure both files have identical architecture descriptions
   - Add "role-management" to README.md tools directory list

4. **Clean Up Tool Names**
   - Remove or fix the "Team Meeting" tool that appears to be test data
   - Ensure all tool names follow consistent naming conventions

5. **Version Documentation**
   - Add documentation for the version resource (`digitalsamba://version`)

6. **Consolidate Hybrid Approach Documentation**
   - The hybrid approach explanation appears in both files but with variations
   - Consider having one canonical explanation and referencing it

### Additional Notes

- The API documentation in `docs/digital-samba-api.md` appears comprehensive and well-structured
- The testing documentation in `tests/README.md` is appropriate for its scope
- CONTRIBUTING.md is standard and doesn't require updates for this review

## Next Steps

1. Update all documentation files with correct counts
2. Synchronize duplicated sections between README.md and CLAUDE.md
3. Review and clean up any test data that leaked into production code
4. Consider adding automated documentation generation to keep counts accurate
